## Notes
### **I didn't see necessary implement all the needed fonts through the files you sent me within the assets because I already had a helper in the core to load custom fonts from custom sources.**

<br />

So please check the file `index.js` located in `src/core` and the `material-ui.js` located in `src/styles` to review the full implementation:

```javascript
// core/index.js
WebFontLoader.load({
    google: {
        families: [
            'Fira Sans',
            'Material Icons',
            'Montserrat',
            'Roboto:300,400,500,700'
        ]
    },
    custom: {
        families: ['FontAwesome'],
        urls: ['https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.5.0/css/font-awesome.min.css']
    }
});

// styles/material-ui.js
export const theme = createMuiTheme({
    typography: {
        fontFamily: [
            '"Montserrat"',
            '"Fira Sans"',
            'sans-serif'
        ].join(',')
    }
});
```

## How to run locally

Once you already clone this repo just go the root folder and run:

```bash
# Install needed packages
> npm install
# Run local server
> npm run start
# Happy hacking!
```

## Switch between mock services and real services

Open the `globals.json` file located in `src/config/settings` and toggle the property `isEnabled` in `serviceMocker` object:

```json
"serviceMocker": {
    "delayResponse": 300,
    "isEnabled": true,
    "loginEmail": "admin@wolox.com.ar",
    "loginPassword": "MTIzNDU2",
    "passwordRecoveryCode": "MTIzNDU2"
}
```
